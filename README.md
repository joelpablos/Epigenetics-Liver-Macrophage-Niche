Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project **"Epigenomic Profiling of the Regulatory Landscape in the Liver Macrophage Niche"**. This repository contains the comprehensive code and resources developed during the course of this research project. Our study aimed to unravel the intricate **regulatory mechanisms** within the hepatic macrophage niche, focusing on its major cell types **—Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatocytes.**

The custom bioinformatic pipelines for the whole analytical process, from data preprocessing to final interpretation, are found here. Each cell type's distinct properties have been taken into account when developing these pipelines, resulting in accurate and informative findings. Along with the regulatory signatures and interactions inside the liver macrophage niche, the repository also keeps some results data tables.
